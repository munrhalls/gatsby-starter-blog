DISCLAIMER: The tone or concept in all the articles I'm sharing here, is about me teaching myself. It's NOT me trying to tell the reader "HEY, HERE'S WHAT'S UP". I'm merely sharing my journey. I also don't care if you agree or not, with whatever you happen to be agreeing with or not. Take your tea, your cakes or whatever and have a nice read.

#PSYCHOLOGICAL RESILIENCE AND CONFIDENCE

Archilocos, Greek warrior, stated: "We don't raise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training".

But we can fall far, far below the level of our training.

Confidence, for example, works in reverse of what people understand it as.

You can't just start playing a great guitar piece if you've never trained playing on guitar before, no matter how enormously confident you happen to be.

However, a person can be significantly diminished or even blocked from playing a great guitar piece that they've already played and performed a hundred times before - if you can somehow bring down or entangle their confidence.

Confidence IS NOT an enabler of hard-to-believe feats, abnormal learning rate or very impropable achievements.
Confidence IS the protector of real skills and abilities to both learn and perform that you and only you know that you have - regardless of whatever anyone else thinks about any of it.

##PSYCHOLOGICAL RESILIENCE AND BEING RELENTLESSLY PROACTIVE

The world exerts pressure. People exert pressure. There are enormous amounts of influence, all kinds of influence, all the time. Lack of psychological resilience creates scenarios where real abilities and skills you have trained, learned, honed and acquired, won't even matter - it'll as if you didn't even ever train, learn, develop and hone any of them at all.

You need to exert your own kind of pressure, asserting your own psychological influence. Then, your skills and abilities have an equivalent of a protected psychological space, within which you can express them with minimal to no hindrance.s

Josh Waitzkin, in his book "The art of learning", states that psychological resilience is arguably the most important trait of any competitor. That's a very curious point, coming from a multi-disciplinary champion of both of mental (chess) and physical (martial arts) sports. In this book, author also states that at the highest levels, everyone's got great technique. What differentiates champions, is almost always about psychological factors.

This dynamic influences everything a person is doing at all times.

It doesn't occur at some future time. It's not happening when someone is experiencing this big moment of truth, this big presentation or match or meeting or interview. It's happening in every trivial, small moment that you go through, one by one.

There are only a few big moments but there are thousands upon thousands of small moments. Anything that's real - including psychological resilience - occurs in those small moments.

We're not talking about psychological resilience when a "BIG MOMENT" because it's not real. At that point, it's already shaped. It's defined by what was going on with it when all those small moments were happening.
