Disclaimer: The tone or concept in all the articles I'm sharing here, is about me teaching myself. It's NOT me trying to tell the reader "HEY, LISTEN, SIT DOWN AND LISTEN, H E R E'S W H A T'S U P. HERE'S HOW THIS AND THAT WORKS. AND HERE'S HOW THE WORLD WORKS BECAUSE THIS AND THAT, AND BECAUSE THIS QUOTE AND THIS GREATLY GREAT SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE AND GREATLY-GREAT-GREAT BOOK AND EVEN GREATLY-GREATER-GREATER GREAT AUTHOR. THAT'S WHAT'S UP, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, GET IT?". No. I'm just sharing my journey. I also don't care if you agree or not, with whatever you happen to be agreeing with or not. Take your tea, your cakes and your coffee with honey that loses most of it's nutritional value the moment you put into such a hot beverage, or your crackers or whatever, sit and have a nice read or not.

PSYCHOLOGICAL PRECEDES TECHNICAL.

So what that you have the skills and you can, whatever and however much it is that you can, if it's trivially easy to psychologically distract, derail or otherwise thwart you?

Whatever you can or know how to perform, your abilities are only about as accessible as your psychological resilience allows. Conversely, whatever areas of lack are present in the sphere of your psychological resilience, it'll limit your abilities far below their real level.

PSYCHOLOGICAL RESILIENCE AND CONFIDENCE

Archilocos, Greek warrior, stated: "We don't raise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training".

But we can fall far, far below the level of our training.

Confidence, for example, works in reverse of what people understand it as.

You can't just start playing great piano piece if you've never trained it, no matter how enormously confident you happen to be.

However, a person can be literally blocked and stopped from playing a great piano piece that they've already played and performed a hundred times before - if you can somehow bring down, entangle their confidence.

Confidence IS NOT the enabler of miraculous feats, abnormal learning rate or seemingly impossible achievements.
Confidence IS the protector of real skills and abilities that you and only you know that you have - regardless of whatever anyone else happens to be thinking about them.

However, when you do have that confidence - understood for what it is in reality, as noted above - then, then you can what a lot of people seemingly can't. It can seem like abnormal learning rate or seemingly hard-to-believe achievements. However, again - confidence is the reverse of what people think about it.

When you actually realize those abnormal achievements or learning rate, your actions aren't in any way abnormal in reality, they're just less bogged down by misconceptions. Confidence is NOT an enabler of new abilities, it is the protector of what you and only you KNOW that you can do or learn, regardless of whatever anyone else might think or believe or be convinced about it.

PSYCHOLOGICAL RESILIENCE IS AN ACTIVE TRAIT

There's a reason why performance psychology, sports psychology, exists: it's real. It's one of the most real and fundamental disciplines. You don't just get to express your skills and abilities unhindered in this world. Whatever you can, it needs to go in tandem with the ability to protect and assert it, if challenged.

The world exerts pressure. People exert pressure. There are enormous amounts of influence, all kinds of influence, all the time. Lack of psychological resilience creates scenarios where real abilities and skills you have trained, learned, honed and acquired, won't even matter - it'll as if you didn't even ever train, learn, develop and hone any of them at all.

You need to exert your own kind of pressure, asserting your own psychological influence. Then, your skills and abilities have an equivalent of a protected psychological space, within which you can express them with minimal to no hindrance.

Josh Waitzkin, in his book "The art of learning", states that psychological resilience is arguably the most important trait of any competitor. That's a very curious point, coming from a multi-disciplinary champion of both of mental (chess) and physical (martial arts) sports. In this book, author also states that at the highest levels, everyone's got great technique. What differentiates champions, is almost always about psychological factors.

This dynamic influences everything a person is doing at all times.

It doesn't occur at some future time. It's not happening when someone is experiencing this big moment of truth, this big presentation or match or meeting or interview. It's happening in every trivial, small moment that you go through, one by one.

There are only a few big moments but there are thousands upon thousands of small moments. Anything that's real - including psychological resilience - occurs in those small moments.

We're not talking about psychological resilience when a "BIG MOMENT" because it's not real. At that point, it's already shaped. It's defined by what was going on with it when all those small moments were happening.
