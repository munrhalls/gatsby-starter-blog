#Returns / unit of time

Same AMOUNT of time & energy can produce different results. Many people view this subject very linearly. More hours = more outcomes. Nothing could be more wrong. Technology itself is possible, and actually builds around, the simple fact that you can do more with less input, provided you figure out how to put things together in a way that amplifies whatever the input is, in certain repeatable ways.

##Amplifying the output from the input in certain repetable ways

This is possible when you get two or more elements of whatever your input is, to get some extra work going, that's not dependent on the original input.

It's organizational engineering.

Really, it's just organizing things in a way that enables them to coordinate and/or synchronize in some ways that, in conjunction with existing physical laws, get something extra out of the same input.

##Complexity is build from simplicities that are made to relate with each other

It sounds all sciencey but - and this is very important to understand - all advanced concepts ultimately build upon, and distill down to, some very simple fundamental ideas. Advanced understandings aren't inherently advanced - they are advanced and complicated due to scale effects. Multiple simple things start to form various inter-relationships, and it is these inter-relationships that become complicated to track and make sense of.

Big inventions, technologies and solutions, all started from extremely simpler, primitive prototypes and pre-cursors.

##Returns / unit of time from the inside

If you understand the paragraph above, you can understand why returns / unit of time is not a linear topic. This isn't a discussion about how to put more hours into some endeavor in order to succeed in it. This is a discussion about how to put SAME amount of hours into some endeavor and INCREASE the amount of useful returns per that same amount of hours. In other words, you can work on doing more hours, or you can work on getting more out of an hour.

This is where we meet a fork in the road.

This is NOT a discussion where vague, naive ideas like "just focus harder", "you just have to really want it" and other puke-worthy levels of commentary are of any relevance. Attitudes of not checking ideas and running away from admitting one's lack of knowledge are the opposite of what this discussion is about. It's about being eager to check and find flaws and falsehoods in one's knowledge, realizing that there's nothing wrong about it. We all know near nothing about anything. That's a simple fact. We know close to nothing about anything. We just know a little more than before but that's all.

With that attitude, we can understand that what is relevant, is that one's work input can be decomposed into it's component parts, where inter-relationships between those component parts can be examined. When this is enabled, it gets very interesting because now you can also implement scale - you can examine at macro level but you can also examine with equivalents of a microscope, that enable perceptions on what occurs on the micro-levels of work input.

That's the aim.

##Returns / unit of time, the principle and translating it for the purpose of coming up with a framework

Domino effect creates massive change with most minimal input because all the work after initial input, is performed by the mechanical effect that's stacked on top of itself - the domino pushing next domino, which pushes next domino and so on.

Technology largely revolves around this principle, at least a lot of it. It's stacking various mechanical effects in useful ways, such that they enter into causal relationships between each other, which means huge amounts of original input required are replaced by these stacked mechanical effects and causal relationships between them.

The principle is that stacking mechanical effects in useful ways + causally relating them in useful ways = replacing proportional amount of the original input requirement.

E.g. in a domino effect, you can knock every domino piece on its own, if they were all scattered and to be knocked down. Or you can line them up, push just the first one, and it launches a serie of connected, stacked mechanical effects that are causally related to each other and replace literally ALL further input requirement.

You can just say "yeah, it's a mechanical effect, one pushes the other, why do you have to put it in some sciencey-sound nonsense gibberish"? Fair point but we're trying to come up with a framework, which requires translating something seemingly "simple" into terms that are much more accurate and precise - enough to start creating a technically accurate explanation.

Technically accurate explanation isn't about how the world really works with respect to some thing.

It's about a technically accurate explanation that's hard to vary or replace, while being easy to falsify. It's about a technically accurate explanation that produces better results than alternatives - in terms of what it enables one to think of and come up with and actually make happen in the real world.

These remarks are looses collected ideas. Treat it as an introduction to the subject of returns / unit of time.

As always, this is just me sharing my explorations and learning adventures. It isn't meant to convince anyone of anything.
