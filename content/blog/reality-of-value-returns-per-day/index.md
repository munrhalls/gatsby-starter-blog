This article is a mere introduction, an onramp to a network of interconnected concepts about being efficient and effective. Same amount of time and work, can produce vastly different measures of desirable value returns (results). A person can work for 3 hours and achieve nothing, a bit of something, quite a lot or immensely much.

What are the factors that determine the difference?

This idea of ratio, of (results / time), is a very strategic concept.

Most explanations attempt to flatten this discourse. Most comments trivilize such explorations, indicating that to examine it, is pointless and impractical. In reality, it's difficult and requires a lot of careful, insightful thought but none of that makes it any less useful than it is.

In reality, few topics appear as interesting to me as this. What can be more practical and useful than engineering ways to achieve better rates of (value returns / time)?

Results aren't merely about how much time one invests. One can invest much less time and achieve much greater results, and the world is full of such examples. You can work more hours to achieve a resuls or you can work with better ratio of (results / hour).

Let's explore this a bit more, as these are two extremely different directions of thinking:

1. invest more hours to achieve a resuls (flat approach, one-level thinking),
2. invest into better ratio of results per time (deeper approach, many-levels thinking).

If you needed to complete 10 complicated reports as soon as you could, first approach would indicate putting more hours into it. Second approach would indicate engineering a more efficient and effective way of going about it.

First approach is fundamentally limited...we all only have so much time. In fact, most endeavors in the modern world, are pretty hopeless if one relies on pouring more hours onto a goal to be achieved.
