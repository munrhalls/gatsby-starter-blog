Let's start from the concept of 2D work considerations. 2D work? This relates to a simple fact: most people talk about work in terms of amount of time input and that's about it. Worked for this and that amount of hours. Working hard is typically mentioned, which is typically just a reference to intensity.

2D work considerations is a title which, hopefully, points to the problem with this approach: missing depths.

Josh Waitzkin, in his book The Art of Learning, mentions how we live in an attention deficit culture. How people are like surface-bound fish, lost in shallow currents of perpetual distraction. Completely unaware of the georgeous abyss below.

This is extremely relevant to any real discussion about increasing work results per unit of time. By definition, this has nothing to do with increasing the amount of hours you work. It has to do with increasing the amount real and useful value returns per hour of work. What that means, the only way you can achieve that, is to operate on your way of working. Working on how you work. In other words, depth. Z-axis.

This very quickly becomes highly problematic for most people. This goes against the habit of swimming along in the comfortable currents of perpetual distractions. Rush. Phones. Messages. Emails. Social media. News. More, more, more. More hours. More intensity. Harder and harder work. That looks good to others, typically. It makes good impressions. Very tired-looking people, typically underslept, working endless hours.

In reality, it's literally decreasing, by an order of magnitude, real value returns from whatever work is being done. That's the real effect of attempts to increase real value returns, real work results, by the means of increasing time input or how many hours one works to generate a result.

All kinds of great personas and gurus stress the importance of hard work and discipline, and most of it is repeating the same problem: 2D work. Just work more hours. Just work more intensely.

This is nonsense in reality. It does not work. It doesn't create more results, it creates less. It's not based in any deep, intelligent thought. It's based in parrotting very poorly understood and very general, vague terms that don't mean much.

Work is typically thought of in terms of input and intensity. Worked on this and this. Worked very hard for very long. Worked for 2 hours worked on that thing, worked for 10 hours on some other thing.

These seemingly innocent statements carry behind them concepts that are of strategic relevance, which either helps or harms your results.

Let's get clear on the following terms:

- practical,
- value return,
- per day.

First, let's get some clarity on what the following terms mean:

- result
- value returns

Result. Definition of result. Why it matters.

One's definition of what is a result, what counts as a result, is of huge strategic importance. It's one of the most determining factors, a core driver of one's proactivity (or lack thereof). It determines, in large, whether entire vastness of one's psychology acts in on a unified, reasonable course of action or against itself and needed, desired value returns.

A result is NOT what people typically think of it. When people talk about results, they talk about things they have no control over. That means, they think they are talking about results. In reality, they are talking about shared misconceptions and falsehoods.

Think about it that way - if a result happened, that was outside of your control, then how is that your result? That had nothing to do with what you could do. It wasn't your result at all. That's a subtle but vital discernment. This is where most misunderstanding about this subject lies and this misunderstanding, ensures that many people that could otherwise be taking massive action, don't.

For example, if you talked to a person and they accepted you, is that a result for you? If you had a task to sell 3 cars this month, is that your result? If you had a task to write 3 pages for your new book this day, is that a real result?

If any of these questions appear like a "yes" to you, that's a hugely strategic misunderstanding.

Value return is about something utterly real, whatever that is. It is NOT about something that's made up or intermixed with some fabrications. It's not an attempt to re-interpret situation. It's not trying to make something that isn't really value to a person, into a value, by means of lying to oneself.

At the same time, it is extremely subjective. Whatever is a practically, subjectively desirable - but also real - result. Subjectively - because that depends on the person, person's situation, person's unique predispositions and preferences, really, everything about the person. In sum, it's just whatever makes you feel satisfied that you accomplished that.
