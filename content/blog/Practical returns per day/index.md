First, let's get some clarity on what the following terms mean:

- result
- value returns
- per day.

Result.

A result is NOT what people typically think of it. When people talk about results, they talk about things they have no control over. That means, they think they are talking about results. In reality, they are talking about shared misconceptions and falsehoods.

Think about it that way - if a result happened, that was outside of your control, then how is that your result? That had nothing to do with what you could do. It wasn't your result at all. That's a subtle but vital discernment. This is where most misunderstanding about this subject lies and this misunderstanding, ensures that many people that could otherwise be taking massive action, don't. 

For example, if you talked to a person and they accepted you, is that a result for you? If you had a task to sell 3 cars this month, is that your result? If you had a task to write 3 pages for your new book this day, is that a real result?

If any of these questions appear like a "yes" to you, that's a hugely strategic misunderstanding. 

Value return is about something utterly real, whatever that is. It is NOT about something that's made up or intermixed with some fabrications. It's not an attempt to re-interpret situation. It's not trying to make something that isn't really value to a person, into a value, by means of lying to oneself.

At the same time, it is extremely subjective. Whatever is a practically, subjectively desirable - but also real - result. Subjectively - because that depends on the person, person's situation, person's unique predispositions and preferences, really, everything about the person. In sum, it's just whatever makes you feel satisfied that you accomplished that.
